# improved-initiative
*Combat tracker for Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) 5th Edition*

The official Improved Initiative app lives at https://www.improved-initiative.com

To run, install node.js and run the following in the cloned directory:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Once the Improved Initiative app is running, the ui can be accessed at <http://localhost>

You can start the dev build process by running `grunt`. This will automatically rebuild the project when you change any TypeScript or LessCSS files.

Development of Improved Initiative is supported through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/improvedinitiative).

Refer to **CONTRIBUTING.md** if you'd like to contribute code.

## App Settings
You can configure your instance of Improved Initiative with these settings. All are optional, basic functionality should work if you don't specify any.

* `PORT` - Defaults to 80
* `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" to satisfy react, set to "development" to disable html view caching.
* `BASE_URL` - Used in absolute URLs on client side. Falls back to relative urls if unavailable. This is the canonical URL for Patreon callback and browser localStorage.
* `SESSION_SECRET` - Used to keep session continuity through app restarts or something. Handed to express-session.
* `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_LEVEL` - Set to "accountsync" or "epicinitiative" to grant rewards to all users. Useful if you have no DB.  
* `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` - Provide a DB connection string for session and user account storage. In memory Mongo DB will be used otherwise, which is cleared on app restart.
* `KEEN_API_URL`, `KEEN_PROJECT_ID`, `KEEN_READ_KEY`, `KEEN_WRITE_KEY` - Configuration for metrics pipeline
* `PATREON_URL`, `PATREON_CLIENT_ID`, `PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET` - Configuration for Patreon integration

## Docker

Running Improved Initiative within Docker is possible, but completely optional and currently experimental. Proceed with caution and when in doubt, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Building the Docker Image
To build the docker image with a development build, run:

`docker build -t improved-initiative:latest .`

To build the image with a production build, run:

`docker build --build-arg NODE_ENV=production -t improved-initiative:prod .`

### Running the App in a Docker Container
To start the application within the container, run:

`docker run -p80:80 --name improved-initiative improved-initiative:latest`

Or, to run the production build:

`docker run -p80:80 --name improved-initiative improved-initiative:prod`

### Stopping and Removing the Container

Assuming you started the container with the name `improved-initiative` as shown above, the following commands will stop the container and then remove it:

`docker stop improved-initiative`

`docker rm improved-initiative`
